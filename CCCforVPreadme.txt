Please note, this is a modification to the code from the original Cactus Canyon Complete P-ROC code modification available at
http://soldmy.org/pin/ccc/index.php?title=Main_Page to run with Visual Pinball and the Skeleton P-ROC framework.

DO NOT CONTACT THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THE P-ROC PROJECT ABOUT THIS GAME CODE - THEY ARE TWO SEPERATE PROJECTS.  SEEK SUPPORT FOR THE VISUAL PINBALL VERSION AT http://vpuniverse.com

One other important thing is that P-ROC (at the moment) cannot use the new VBS scripts that are packaged in the final release of VPX.
 
Use with VP 10.0
 
You have to use the script that are included in this archive with VPX and P-ROC or some ball kickouts etc. may break.
