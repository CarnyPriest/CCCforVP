Please note, this is a modification to the code from the original Cactus Canyon Complete P-ROC code modification available at
http://soldmy.org/pin/ccc/index.php?title=Main_Page to run with Visual Pinball and the Skeleton P-ROC framework.

DO NOT CONTACT THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THE P-ROC PROJECT ABOUT THIS GAME CODE - THEY ARE TWO SEPERATE PROJECTS.  

SEEK SUPPORT FOR THE VISUAL PINBALL VERSION AT http://vpuniverse.com/forums/topic/2286-cactus-canyon-continued-proc-in-vp

One other important thing is that P-ROC (at the moment) cannot use the new VBS scripts that are packaged in the final release of VPX.
